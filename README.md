===========================

Profiler is an Android application which is based on Location aware profile changing of the mobile phone. This application provides the user with an ability to change the profile mode of their Mobile phone (Silent, Loud or Vibrate ) automatically by storing the location coordinates of a particular location along with the profile mode which needs to be activated when it reaches that desired location. A location monitoring service is used to achieve this functionality.
